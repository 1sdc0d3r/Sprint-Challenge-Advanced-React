- [ ] Why would you use class component over function components (removing hooks from the question)?
  <!-- ! I find it easier to pass state throughout the application. Keep state all together to be able to access more methods -->
- [ ] Name three lifecycle methods and their purposes.
  <!-- ! componentDidMount -- run through once when component mounts the first time
  componentDidUpdate -- Runs through the function every time the component rerenders -->
  componentDidUnMount -- Clean up event listeners from Mount as well
- [ ] What is the purpose of a custom hook?
      DRY CODE, able to reuse for multiple purposes

- [ ] Why is it important to test our apps?
      Test user functionality and make sure that everything will function correctly to be able to find bugs easier later
